# Striker

The Resistance remains in the Arctic Ocean. In the Spitsbergen Nuclear Facility,
at the Svalbard Archipelago, near the town of Longyearbyen, you're under attack
and needs to shoot down all enemy missiles. The Resistance needs your help
fighting the Enemy.

## Gameplay

Enemy missiles are colored red, and their targets (Spitsbergen Nuclear Facility
and Longyearbyen) yellow. Use you mouse to aim and the left button to deploy a
missile. Once a missile is deployed, it's target is marked as a little orange
dot. If a missile don't strike any enemy missile until it reaches it's target,
it falls. Our guidance system can only keep 3 missiles flying at once, so aim
carefully!

A third of enemy missiles are target at the town of Longyearbyen. Each enemy
missile striked scores you two points if the town is still there. Once the town
is bombed, each strike is only a point. Once the Spitsbergen Nuclear Facility is
bombed, you're dead. Game over to you and the Resistance.

## Build

Place `libraylib.a` and `raylib.h` at the project directory and run
`./build.sh`. I think it only works with Raylib >=5.0 but idk.
